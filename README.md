> `Cloud scheduling` refers to allocating the users tasks on the available resources to improve execution of tasks, and increase resource utilization. **Task scheduling** is considered as an NP problem. The task scheduling mainly focuses to enhance the efficient utilization of resources and hence reduction in task completion time. Task scheduling is used to allocate certain tasks to
particular resources at a particular time instance. So a heuristic method has to be used to generate required path to schedule.

> In this project, Genetic Algorithm is used. `Genetic algorithm` is a **meta-heuristic method** which generates efficient candidate solution from the pool of available parent solutions. The
genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and **unconstrained optimization problems** that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. This genetic
algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to
produce the children for the next generation. By providing the required criteria for resources,genetic algorithm produces a required candidate solution.
